      <description>As everyone notes it is an interesting era to be a woman – the last twelve months have created a new urgency and voice for change. I’m aware that now more than ever we need more leadership role models, visibility and support for the next wave of future STEM women.
I feel very lucky to have my own stories: One of an elderly cousin who was one of the first wave of women to go to university to study medicine, (she had to go to Scotland because English universities wouldn’t accept women at that time), and the second of my mother, an engineer who researches metals, who worked in male dominated labs throughout the sixties, was a working mum, and one of the Government scientists trained to work in the cold war nuclear bunkers dotted across London.</description>
