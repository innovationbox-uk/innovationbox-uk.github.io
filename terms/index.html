<h2 id="1-welcome-to-innovation-unboxed"><strong>1. Welcome to Innovation Unboxed</strong></h2>

<p>This page explains our terms of use. When you sign up or register to the Innovation Unboxed mailing list, website and social media you are agreeing to all the rules on this page. Some of them need to be expressed in legal terms, but we&#39;ve done our best to offer you clear and simple explanations of what everything means (these are not the terms and are therefore highlighted to show the distinction).</p>

<p>Welcome to Innovation Unboxed. By using this website (the &quot;Site&quot;) and online subscription services (together with the Site, the &quot;Services&quot;) offered by Innovation Unboxed, together with the sites and pages of our Innovation Unboxed partners and their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors — collectively, &quot;Innovation Unboxed,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; or &quot;us&quot;), you&#39;re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the &quot;Terms&quot;). You&#39;re also agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, and agreeing to follow any other rules on the site.</p>

<p>We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we&#39;ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the site or by sending you an email. New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively — we&#39;ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you keep using Innovation Unboxed mailing lists after a change, that means you accept the new terms.</p>

<p>Innovation Unboxed is for your personal, non-commercial use, except as explained in section 4 and section 5 below.</p>

<p><strong>2. About Creating an Account</strong></p>

<p>You are responsible for your account and all the activity on it.</p>

<p>You can browse the Innovation Unboxed website without subscribing to our mailing list. But to use some of the Innovation Unboxed website functions and services, you&#39;ll need to register, choose a username, and set a password. When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete. Don&#39;t impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive or that violate anyone&#39;s rights. If you don&#39;t follow these rules, we may cancel your account.</p>

<p>You&#39;re responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential. If you find out that someone&#39;s used your account without your permission, you should report it to info@innovationunboxed.org</p>

<h2 id="3-things-you-definitely-shouldn-39-t-do"><strong>3. Things You Definitely Shouldn&#39;t Do</strong></h2>

<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t spam.</strong>  Don&#39;t distribute unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or promotional material, or any junk mail, spam, or chain letters. Don&#39;t run mail lists, listservs, or any kind of auto-responder or spam on or through the Site.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Don&#39;t harm anyone&#39;s computer.</strong>  Don&#39;t distribute software viruses, or anything else (code, films, programs) designed to interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or equipment on the Site (whether it belongs to Innovation Unboxed or another party).</p></li>

<li><p>Don&#39;t try to interfere with the proper workings of the website.</p></li>

<li><p>Don&#39;t bypass any measures we&#39;ve put in place to secure the website or online services.</p></li>

<li><p>Don&#39;t try to damage or get unauthorized access to any system, data, password, or other information, whether it belongs to Innovation Unboxed or another party.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="4-what-we-don-39-t-do-and-aren-39-t-responsible-for"><strong>4. What We Don&#39;t Do and Aren&#39;t Responsible For</strong></h2>

<p>We don&#39;t become involved in disputes between users, or between users and any third party relating to the use of the website.</p>

<p>When you use the website, you release Innovation Unboxed from claims, damages, and demands of every kind — known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed — arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and the website. All content you access through the website is at your own risk. You&#39;re solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.</p>

<p><strong>5. Other websites</strong></p>

<p>Innovation Unboxed&#39;s website may contain links to other websites. (For instance, project pages, user profiles, and comments may link to other sites.) When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. We don&#39;t control or endorse those sites.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong>  <strong>Your Intellectual Property</strong></p>

<p>We don&#39;t own the information you post on Innovation Unboxed&#39;s website. But when you post it, you are giving us permission to use it or copy it however we need to run the website effectively, or to show people what is happening on it. (We generally just use this to promote research and projects and to showcase the work of our network on the website or in our newsletter). You are responsible for the content you post, and you are vouching that is okay for us to use.</p>

<p>When you submit a project or a piece of research to share you agree to these terms:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>We can use the content you&#39;ve posted or shared through our website (or other online channels).</strong> You grant to us, and others acting on our behalf, the worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, transferable right to use, exercise, and exploit content posted, publicity, and with respect to your content posted.</li>
<li><strong>When we use the content, we can make changes, like editing or translating it.</strong>  You grant us the right to excerpt, delete, or translate any of your content posted. We will only edit or amend content wording with your direct permission</li>
<li><strong>You won&#39;t submit information you don&#39;t hold the copyright for (unless you have permission).</strong> Your Content will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material, or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material (and to grant Innovation Unboxed all the license rights outlined here).</li>
<li><strong>Any rights or licensing on your Content are your responsibility.</strong>  You will pay all rights or amounts owed to any person or entity based on your Content, or on Innovation Unboxed&#39;s hosting of that Content.</li>
<li><strong>You promise that if we use your Content, we&#39;re not violating anyone&#39;s rights or copyrights.</strong>  If Innovation Unboxed or its users exploit or make use of your submission in the ways contemplated in this agreement, you promise that this will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including (without limitation) any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.</li>
<li><strong>You&#39;re responsible for the information you post.</strong>  All information submitted to the website, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom that content originated.</li>
<li><strong>We&#39;re not responsible for mistakes in your content.</strong>  Innovation Unboxed will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Innovation Unboxed&#39;s</strong>  <strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>

<p>The content on the Innovation Unboxed website is protected in various ways. You do have the right to use it for certain personal purposes, but you cannot use it externally without prior permission first.</p>

<p>You agree to respect all copyright, intellectual property rights and other legal notices, information, and restrictions contained in any content accessed through the website.</p>

<p>If you want to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, or store any of this content for a commercial purpose, you need prior written permission from Innovation Unboxed or the author or copyright holder. A &quot;commercial purpose&quot; means you intend to use, sell, license, rent, or otherwise exploit content for commercial use, in any way.</p>

<p><strong>8. How we deal with Copyright Issues</strong></p>

<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act lays out a system of legal requirements for dealing with allegations of copyright infringement. Innovation Unboxed complies with the DMCA, and we respond to notices of alleged infringement if they comply with the law and the requirements set forth in our Copyright Policy. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate accounts for repeat infringers. (We do this when appropriate and at our sole discretion.)</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong>  <strong>Deleting Your Account</strong></p>

<p>You can terminate your subscription at any time through your account settings. We may retain certain information as required by law. All provisions of this agreement survive termination of an account, including our rights regarding any content you&#39;ve already submitted to the website. You can contact us at  <a href="mailto:info@innovationunboxed.org">info@innovationunboxed.org</a> <a href="mailto:info@innovationunboxed.org"> </a>for additional information or to request project page deletion (this is not available in all circumstances).</p>

<p><strong>10. Our Rights</strong></p>

<p>To operate, we need to be able to maintain control over what happens on our website. In this section, we reserve the right to make decisions to protect the health and integrity of our system.</p>

<p>Innovation Unboxed reserves these rights:</p>

<ul>
<li>We can make changes to the Innovation Unboxed website and services without notice or liability.</li>
<li>We have the right to decide who&#39;s eligible to sign-up to the Innovation Unboxed website and subscriptions. We can cancel accounts or decline to offer our services. (Especially if you&#39;re abusing them.) We can change our eligibility criteria at any time. If these things are prohibited by law where you live, then we revoke your right to use Innovation Unboxed&#39;s services in that jurisdiction.</li>
<li>We have the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend any project at any time and for any reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>Innovation Unboxed is not liable for any damages as a result of any of these actions, and it is our policy not to comment on the reasons for any such action.</p>

<p><strong>11. Indemnification</strong></p>

<p>If you do something that gets us sued, or break any of the promises you make in this agreement, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from all liabilities, claims, and expenses (including reasonable legal&#39; fees and other legal costs) that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of Innovation Unboxed&#39;s online services.</p>

<p><strong>12. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>

<p><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Innovation Unboxed, its board, employees, partners, suppliers, or content providers be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, consequential, special, or exemplary damages of any kind, including but not limited to damages (i) resulting from your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the website or services we provide; (ii) for any lost profits, data loss, or cost of procurement or substitute goods or services; or (iii) for any conduct of content of any third party on the website or subscription services. In no event shall Innovation Unboxed&#39;s liability for direct damages be in excess of (in the aggregate) one hundred pounds (£100.00).</strong></p>

<p><strong>13. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</strong></p>

<p>We at Innovation Unboxed encourage you to contact us if you&#39;re having an issue, before resorting to the courts. In the unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these Terms (and all other rules, policies, or guidelines incorporated by reference) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the ICO, UK.</p>

<p><strong>14. The Rest</strong></p>

<p><strong>These are our official terms and rules for the use of our services online.</strong></p>

<p>These Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and Innovation Unboxed with respect to its website and subscription services. They supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and Innovation Unboxed with respect to the website and subscription services and govern our future relationship. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either you or Innovation Unboxed to exercise any right provided for in these Terms in any way won&#39;t be deemed a waiver of any other rights.</p>

<p>These Terms are personal to you. You can&#39;t assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get Innovation Unboxed&#39;s prior written consent. Innovation Unboxed has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent. Innovation Unboxed will provide you notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting the notice on our Site.</p>

<p>These updated terms will come into effect on May 25, 2018, and apply to all projects launched on Innovation Unboxed on or after that date.</p>
