      <description>Making sense of what ‘digital maturity’ means in the charity sector Innovation Unboxed worked with Think Social Tech and CAST between May to June 2019 to build a picture of the shape and nature of digital maturity frameworks across the charity sector. We analysed their content and identified consistent patterns in how they describe what digital maturity should look like. What surprised us most is that despite the ‘noise’ surrounding digital maturity, there is little shared vision as to what best practice looks like.</description>

      <description>Over the course of the last three months, Innovation Unboxed, Think Social Tech, and CAST have been building a picture of the shape and nature of digital maturity frameworks. Following contributions from a range of stakeholders (responding to this blog post), we identified 50 unique digital maturity diagnostic tools, think pieces, surveys, codes and reports in this Airtable most relevant to the charity sector. We analysed their content and identified consistent patterns in how they describe what digital maturity should look like.</description>

      <title>How can you assess digital maturity in charities?</title>

      <description>In the last few years we’ve seen a plethora of digital codes, tools, principles and frameworks to help us define what successful digital transformation, leadership and practice looks like in the charity sector.
However, I’m also acutely aware that both charities and funders can struggle to implement best practice, whatever stage they are at, or even know what that should look like or how to translate codes and principles in to their everyday work and operations.</description>

      <title>Why don&#39;t we talk about the contributions Disabled People have made to technology?</title>

      <description>In recent decades, technology has been taking over the way we manage our day to day habits, the way we communicate with others or the way we reach information from newspapers, and all this without leaving our house. As the pace of change advances ever more rapidly, we wanted to explore how these technologies have reached the current point and the strong link these developments have in their origins as necessary responses and also the contributions made by Disabled People.</description>

      <title>Insights from Clore leadership placement</title>

      <description>Two days with Helen I spent two days working alongside Helen, so that I could grasp what Digital Transformation means and to see what Leadership in a start-up feels like. Why did I do this? Well, I work as Head of IT for a military charity and I am currently undertaking a 6 month Clore Leadership Programme, a key element of which is to undertake a placement. My mentor (another element of the programme) suggested Helen and put me in touch, when I explained to him that I wanted a better understanding of Digital Transformation.</description>

      <title>What will the future hold for the next wave of STEM women?</title>

      <description>As everyone notes it is an interesting era to be a woman – the last twelve months have created a new urgency and voice for change. I’m aware that now more than ever we need more leadership role models, visibility and support for the next wave of future STEM women.
I feel very lucky to have my own stories: One of an elderly cousin who was one of the first wave of women to go to university to study medicine, (she had to go to Scotland because English universities wouldn’t accept women at that time), and the second of my mother, an engineer who researches metals, who worked in male dominated labs throughout the sixties, was a working mum, and one of the Government scientists trained to work in the cold war nuclear bunkers dotted across London.</description>

      <description>As we were waiting to join our fellow pitchers at the 10x Charity Election 2018 it struck me how much how much the world has changed for charities in the last 10 years and the amazing opportunities that are now possible to charities because of technology.
10x banking embodies the future for both business and consumers in the way we use and consume technology in the world of banking. To me it provides an inspiring and open-minded view about what isn’t working in the current system and where practical steps can be made to do something to practically look at the disconnects and to offer something different.</description>

      <description>what the pace of change in digital means for charities It has become increasingly challenging, over the last 10 years, for many small to medium sized charities to continue to deliver high quality services. Many organisations are struggling to stretch squeezed budgets to be able to provide more evidence of their effectiveness and impact, whilst also supporting more beneficiaries. It’s a brave new world where disruption and innovation have become the watch words of larger charities, and smaller frontline bodies are having to radically redesign both their core operations and delivery models to meet these modern-day challenges.</description>
