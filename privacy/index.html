<h3 id="1-when-do-we-collect-personal-information-about-you-1"><strong>1.     WHEN DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?</strong></h3>

<p>We may hold information relating to you from a number of sources, and will collect personal information about you:</p>

<p>a. When you give it to us  <strong>directly</strong></p>

Depending on your privacy settings for social media services, we may access information from those accounts or services, including from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.  We may use this information to manage our client and network of support records efficiently and effectively.  Clause 5 below provides more information.</p>

<p>d. When you visit our  <strong>website</strong></p>

<p>INNOVATION UNBOXED uses cookies to improve your experience on our website. Please refer to our cookies policy for details on the way our use of cookies may affect your personal data.</p>

<h3 id="2-what-personal-information-do-we-use-1">2. <strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE USE?</strong></h3>

<p>We may collect, store and otherwise process the following kinds of personal information: Your name and contact details, including email address, postal address, telephone number, and social media identity;</p>

<p>Special categories of data</p>

<p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (&quot; <strong>GDPR</strong>&quot;) recognises certain categories of personal information as sensitive, and therefore requiring more protection.

In certain situations, INNOVATION UNBOXED may collect and/or use special categories of data (for example in order to make adjustments for any disabilities or dietary requirements you may have when attending our events). We will only process these special categories of data if there is a valid reason for doing so and where the GDPR allows us to do so. For instance, by seeking your explicit consent to use such data.</p>

<p>We are required to have one or more lawful grounds to collect and use the personal information that we have outlined above. We consider the grounds listed below to be relevant:</p>

<h3 id="5-research-1"><strong>5. RESEARCH</strong></h3>

<p>We may analyse your personal information to create a record of your interests and preferences to help us manage our records efficiently and effectively in support of INNOVATION UNBOXED&#39;s mission.

<p>Fundraising (particularly through our network of supporters) is an important element of our charitable work so we may undertake research or analysis to assess your ability to support INNOVATION UNBOXED financially.  This may include an assessment of your income and/or wealth and our assessment of your willingness to make donations to particular projects or INNOVATION UNBOXED more generally.  We may use analysis to help us identify your likely support for particular projects.  All of these activities are undertaken to ensure that we are working in a cost-effective manner and allow us to raise more funds in support of INNOVATION UNBOXED&#39;s mission.</p>

<p>If you would prefer us not to use your personal information in this way, please let us know by using the contact details included at clause 13.</p>

<h3 id="6-do-we-share-your-personal-information-1"><strong>6. DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></h3>

<p>INNOVATION UNBOXED will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. However, we may disclose your personal information to selected third party processors (such as partners, sub-grantees or sub-contractors) for the purposes outlined at clause 4. The third party in question will be obligated to use any personal data they receive in accordance our instructions.</p>

<p>In particular, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to third parties: in the event that we buy or sell any business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal information to the prospective buyer or seller or such business or assets;</p>

<p>a. if we are under any legal or regulatory obligation to do so; and</p>

<p>b. in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings, in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.</p>

<h3 id="7-international-data-transfers-1">7. <strong>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong></h3>

<p>As we sometimes use third parties to process personal information, it is possible that personal information we collect from you will be transferred to and stored in a location outside the UK or the European Economic Area (&quot; <strong>EEA</strong>&quot;).</p>

<p>By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.</p>

<p>Please note that certain countries outside of the UK or EEA have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security protections. Where your personal information is transferred, stored, and/or otherwise processed outside the UK or EEA in a country which does not offer an equivalent standard of protection to the UK or EEA, we will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that the recipient implements appropriate safeguards designed to protect your personal information.</p>

<p>Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site - so any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the transfer of your personal information, please contact us using the details at clause 13.</p>

<h3 id="9-how-long-do-we-keep-your-personal-information-1">9.  <strong>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></h3>

<p>We will generally remove your personal information from our records six years after the date that it was collected unless (a) we are required to hold for longer for legal or regulatory purposes; or (b) still required in connection with the purpose for which it was collected and/or processed. However, we will remove your personal information from our records before this date if we become aware that (a) your personal information is no longer required in connection with such purpose(s); (b) we are no longer lawfully entitled to process it; or &copy; you validly exercise one of your right of erasure under clause 10.</p>
